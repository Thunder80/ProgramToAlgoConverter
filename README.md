# ProgramToAlgoConverter
AlgoVersion3.java is the latest but unstable.
This is a simple, not so flexible program, to convert a program into an its algorithm. You need to edit the ouput of this program but
this does the 95% job.

How to use this:-
Step 1: Create a input.txt file in the file in the folder where this program is located

Step 2: Paste the C code in the input.txt file, you just have to paste the function of whose algorithm you want					ONLY ONE FUNCTION AT A TIME SHOULD BE PASTED IN THE FILE TO GET THE DESIRED RESULTS

Step 3: Run this program

Step 4: The output should be printed in the console.

Assumptions:
1. Your program is syntactically correct
2. Your program does not contain any unnecessary curly brackets
3. You have used the standard spacings
4. The curly brackets for for-loop, while-loop, if, else, do-while-loop should start on a new line.
5. This program cannot handle switch case or structures algorithm so these should not be included in the code
